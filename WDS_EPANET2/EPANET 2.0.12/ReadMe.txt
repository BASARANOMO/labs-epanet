WELCOME TO EPANET 2.0
=====================
EPANET is a program for analyzing the hydraulic and water quality behavior of pressurized
pipe networks. It was developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Risk
Management Research Laboratory. As such, it is public domain software that may be freely
copied and distributed. A complete Users Manual as well as full source code and other updates
can be downloaded from https://www.epa.gov/water-research/epanet.

FILES INSTALLED BY THE SETUP PROGRAM
====================================
The setup program for EPANET 2.0 places the following files into your EPANET 2 installation
directory:
  epanet2w.exe  -- the Windows version of EPANET 2.0
  epanet2d.exe  -- the DOS command line version of EPANET 2.0
  epanet2.dll   -- the numerical engine used by both epanet2w and epanet2d
  epanet2.chm   -- the EPANET 2.0 Help file
  tutorial.chm  -- the on-line tutorial
  updates.txt   -- a history of updates made to EPANET 2.0
  readme.txt    -- this file

EXAMPLE NETWORKS
================
EPANET 2 also comes with three example pipe networks to help one become familiar with the
program. They are placed in a sub-folder named "EPANET Projects\Examples" in your Documents
folder and consist of the following files:

  net1.net     -- a simple pipe network modeling chlorine decay
  net2.net     -- an example of a tracer study utilizing calibration data
  net2-FL.dat  -- calibration data used with net2.net
  net3.net     -- a larger network model illustrating source tracing

When running any of these networks we recommend that you view the Project Summary first
(select Project >> Summary from the main menu) to read any background notes about the
example.
