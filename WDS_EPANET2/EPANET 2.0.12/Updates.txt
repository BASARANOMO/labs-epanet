EPANET 2 UPDATE HISTORY
=======================

------------------------
Builds 2.00.01 - 2.00.04
------------------------
Beta releases A through D.

----------------------
Build 2.00.05 (6/1/00)
----------------------
The first official release of EPANET 2.0.

-----------------------
Build 2.00.06 (9/11/00)
-----------------------
User Interface Bug Fixes (epanet2w.exe):

1. Using the Property Editor to edit the Base Demand
   for a junction with multiple demand categories now
   correctly updates its value in the internal database.

2. The distances between nodes displayed on a Profile
   Plot have been corrected.

3. The demands in an imported demand scenario file
   are now assigned correctly to the nodes in the
   network.

4. Curved pipes are no longer represented as straight
   lines in map files exported in DXF format.

5. In a Group Edit operation, conditions placed on string
   properties, such as Tags or Demand Patterns, are now
   processed correctly.

Computational Engine Bug Fixes (epanet2.dll and
epanet2d.exe):

1. The conversion factor used for IMGD flow units has been
   corrected. (All flow conversion factors have been 
   updated to maintain 4-5 significant digits. This
   might cause some minor differences in computed results
   from earlier versions.)

2. Any bulk reaction coefficient assigned to a tank
   is now correctly inactivated when a source trace
   analysis is made.

3. The check to see if pipes to full/empty tanks should be
   closed has been modified to account for conditions where
   the headloss across the pipe is negligible (a leftover
   bug from Version 1.1).

4. An FCV closed by a rule can now be restored to either
   an open or active status at a later time via another
   rule.

5. Several tuning parameters and steps of the hydraulic 
   analyis algorithm were modified to enhance its 
   robustness. Appendix D of the EPANET Users Manual has
   been revised to reflect these changes.

------------------------
Build 2.00.07 (12/11/00)
------------------------
User Interface Bug Fixes (epanet2w.exe)

6. Using the Property Editor to edit the Base Demand for a
   junction with multiple demand categories now correctly
   updates its value in the internal database (see Bug 1
   above) and also passes this value to the network solver
   when an analysis is made.

7. The program now runs correctly when there are no
   printers installed for Windows.

8. A custom zoom window can now be drawn in any direction.
   Before if the window was not drawn from top-left to
   bottom-right then a default zoom (2x) would occur.

9. If the Map Window is in Vertex Editing mode and an
   object is selected from either the Browser or the Map
   Finder then vertex editing will now be disabled and
   the map will be placed into Object Selection mode.

10. The '&' character in an ID label will now display
    correctly in the Flyover map labels.

11. The simulation Time Legend will now display correctly
    when the Clock Start Time option is expressed in decimal
    hours instead of hours:minutes notation.

12. Map printing has been modified so that line widths and
    font sizes remain close to how they appear on the screen.

13. For safety's sake, the Auto-Length feature is automatically
    disabled whenever a new project is opened.


Computational Engine Bug Fixes (epanet2.dll and
epanet2d.exe):

6. The units of SYSTEM DEMAND in rule-based controls have
   been fixed to match those set by the user (rather than
   always be cfs).

7. The 2-compartment tank mixing model has been modified to
   prevent water quality concentrations from "blowing up"
   when tank inflow is almost equal to its outflow.

8. Error message 222 has been added to test if both ends
   of a link are the same node.

9. File names with spaces in them will now be recognized in
   the Toolkit functions ENsavehydfile and ENusehydfile.

10. The Toolkit function ENgetlinkvalue will now correctly
    return the flow in a pump whose status was changed from
    what its initial value was.

11. An error in the way that multi-point pump curves were
    adjusted for a variable speed setting has been fixed.

------------------------
Build 2.00.07a (1/2/01)
------------------------
This build corrects problems that cropped up when fixes
were made to GUI bugs 6 and 12 in Build 2.00.07.


------------------------
Build 2.00.07b (1/5/01)
------------------------
Corrects an oversight in Build 2.00.07a that prevents .NET files
created with Build 2.00.07 from being read by later builds.


-----------------------
Build 2.00.08 (3/2/01)
-----------------------
User Interface Bug Fixes (epanet2w.exe)

14. The Sepoint Booster and Flow Paced Booster options for water
    quality sources were being switched when a network was
    exported to file in ASCE text format.

15. Clicking the Options button on the Standard Toolbar had no
    effect when one wanted to edit options for Graphs,
    Contour Plots, Tables or Calibration Reports.

16. The view variable Headloss is now labelled as Unit Headloss
    to reinforce the fact that it represents the headloss per
    1000 ft (or 1000 m) of pipe.

Computational Engine Bug Fixes (epanet2.dll and
epanet2d.exe):

12. The Toolkit function ENsaveinpfile was not correctly writing
    to file the name of an efficiency curve specified for a pump.

13. The Toolkit function ENgetcontrol was not returning a setting
    value of 0 when the control in question closed a pipe (as
    opposed to a pump).

14. The Toolkit function ENsetqualtype was not re-setting the
    unit conversion factor for concentration when the water
    quality analysis was being changed between chemical, age,
    and trace analyses.

15. In the Toolkit function ENinitH(flag), the flag argument can
    now be a 2-digit number. A 0 or 1 in the right-most digit
    determines if hydraulic results are saved to file or not.
    A 0 or 1 in the left digit determines whether all flows will
    be re-initialized to 1 cfs or not.
    
16. When a numerical setting (as opposed to an OPEN/CLOSED status)
    was assigned to a pipe as the action in a control or rule, the
    action was ignored. Now a numerical setting of 0 means that
    the pipe will close, while a setting greater than 0 will open
    the pipe.

17. It is now illegal to have a Flow Control Valve connected
    directly to the upstream node of a Pressure Sustaining Valve
    or to the downstream node of a Pressure Reducing Valve.

NOTE: The computational engine (epanet2.dll and epanet2d.exe) was
      re-compiled using version 5.5.1 of Borland C++ and version
      5.00 of the Borland linker. Toolkit users who program in
      C/C++ must use the .lib files in the latest version of the
      Toolkit (Build 2.00.08 or higher) to link EPANET2.DLL
      sucessfully with their projects.

------------------------
Build 2.00.09 (11/19/01)
------------------------
User Interface Bug Fixes (epanet2w.exe)

17. The problem with the Setpoint Booster and Flow Paced Booster
    source types being switched when exported (see Item 14 above)
    has finally been fixed.

18. The Background map was not being panned with the network when
    the Find dialog caused a zoomed-in map to pan to the found item.

19. ID labels with double quotes in them, such as 123"abc"456, were
    being imported from .INP files as separate tokens (123, abc,
    and 456) instead of as a single string.

20. X and Y coordinates with many significant digits (i.e., > 8)
    were not being read with full precision from imported .INP files.

Computational Engine Bug Fixes (epanet2.dll and
epanet2d.exe):

18. The flow tolerance used to test the status of PRVs and other
    valves was too large, causing the program to miss some status
    changes under very small flows.

19. The check used to prevent outflow from an empty tank could fail
    when the headloss through the outflow pipe was negligible.

20. The logic used to determine if pumps connected directly to
    full or empty tanks should be closed has been corrected.

21. In the toolkit function ENgetlinkvalue, the check for a closed
    pipe was using the initial pipe status instead of the current
    status.

22. The toolkit function ENsaveinpfile was not writing to file
    correctly the nodal demands and the emitter exponent value.

------------------------
Build 2.00.09a (12/8/01)
------------------------
User Interface Bug Fixes (epanet2w.exe)

21. When drawing objects on the map, the user would be switched back to 
    object selection mode after each object was drawn, rather than
    remaining in drawing mode until the switch was made manually.

------------------------
Build 2.00.10 (6/24/02)
------------------------
User Interface Bug Fixes (epanet2w.exe)

22. The SPEED keyword in the [PUMP] lines of an imported .INP file
    was not being recognized.

23. There was no way to change the reaction order parameter for tanks.
    Now it is always set equal to the value specified for bulk order.

24. More space was added to the columns of a Calibration Report for
    displaying the mean observed and mean predicted values at each
    sampling location.

Computational Engine Bug Fixes (epanet2.dll and
epanet2d.exe):

23. At intermediate times when tanks would normally become full they
    could actually be just below full because EPANET measures time 
    in integer seconds. In some cases this would cause water age in
    the tank to continually increase with time and never reach an
    equilbrium value.

24. The report generated by the command-line or toolkit versions of
    EPANET was printing an incorrect demand charge in its Energy
    section when no demand charge was specified in the input file.

25. The report was also not always able to display very small or very 
    large values in its tables.

26. The Status Report could not distinguish the time of events that
    occurred within seconds of one another (status time is now shown
    as hours:minutes:seconds).

27. No check was being made to ensure that the time pattern assigned
    to a non-primary demand category at a node actually existed.

28. The following toolkit problems were corrected:
    a. map coordinate data was being lost when the ENsaveinpfile
       function was called to overwrite the original input file
    b. not enough decimal places were being used to write out D-W
       roughness heights with the ENsaveinpfile function
    c. when demands are specified in the [DEMANDS] section of the 
       input file instead of the [JUNCTIONS] section, using
       ENgetnodevalue to check on a base demand would return zero
       and trying to change the demand using ENsetnodevalue would
       instead create a new demand category.
    d. ENgetlinkvalue could return an invalid energy value for a
       closed link.

Build 2.00.11 (8/15/07)
-----------------------

Computational Engine Changes (epanet2.dll and epanet2d.exe):
===============================================================================
CODE MODULES  CHANGES
===============================================================================
All           All variables previously declared as floats were re-defined as
              doubles except for those used to write results to binary output
              files and those used as arguments in the toolkit functions. The
              engine is now compiled using Microsoft Visual C/C++ 6.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EPANET.C      The symbols CLE (for command line executable) and SOL (for shared
              object library) were introduced in addition to the existing
              symbol DLL (for dynamic linked library) to support conditional
              compliation for shared object libraries on Unix/Linux.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EPANET.C      EN_INITVOLUME, EN_MIXMODEL and EN_MIXZONEVOL were added to the
EPANET2.H     list of tank parameters that can be retrieved with
TOOLKIT.H     ENgetnodevalue.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EPANET.C      Missing code was added to the ENgetnodevalue function to return
              a value for EN_SOURCEPAT when requested.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EPANET.H      The function declarations in these "include" files were modified
TOOLKIT.H     to support conditional compliation for shared object libraries
              on Unix/Linux.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INPUT3.C      The keyword "HEADLOSS" is no longer confused with "HEAD" when
              parsing reporting variable names in the [REPORT] section of the
              input file.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RULES.C       The input values for a tank's FILLTIME or DRAINTIME in a rule
              premise are now correctly converted to seconds in the
              newpremise() function.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HYDRAUL.C     During hydraulic balancing, status checks on control valves are
              now made only when the convergence error drops to less than a
              factor of 10 of the accuracy limit and a damping factor of 0.6
              is applied to flow changes computed at each iteration beyond
              this point.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HYDRAUL.C     The logic for determining the status of PRVs and PSVs was changed
              to produce more robust solutions, including the case of parallel
              PRVs.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HYDRAUL.C     The matrix coefficients for fully open control valves are now set
              directly rather than by assuming the valve has a certain length
              and friction factor.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HYDRAUL.C     Changes were made to how the P-coefficient for FCVs and the Y-
              coefficient for GPVs are calculated.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HYDRAUL.C     An extraneous "if" statement was removed from the resistance()
              function; the Y-coefficient value in gpvcoeff() was corrected;
              the P-coefficient value in fcvcoeff() was corrected.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
QUALITY.C     The memory pool used for water quality routing segments was given
              the name SegPool and declared as a static global variable.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
QUALITY.C     In the release() function, the upstream node quality is now mixed
              together with that of the upstream pipe segment when the quality
              difference between the two is less than the CTOL tolerance.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INPFILE.C     The ENsaveinpfile toolkit function now writes disabled reporting
              variables to the [REPORT] section of the generated input file.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INPFILE.C     The appearance of an extraneous character at the end of the .INP
              file produced by the toolkit function ENsaveinpfile was fixed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TYPES.H       MAXID was increased to allow ID names to contain up to 31
HASH.C        characters.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TYPES.H       The code version was changed to 20011.
===============================================================================

User Interface Changes (epanet2w.exe)
===============================================================================
CODE MODULES  CHANGES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FMAIN.PAS     The user's program settings are now stored in the user's
UGLOBALS.PAS  Application\Epanet folder on their file system rather than to
UINIFILE.PAS  the Epanet installation folder.
UUTILS.PAS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FSTATUS.PAS   The CopyFile function was replaced by the Delphi library function
UFILEIO.PAS   of the same name.
UUTILS.PAS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UGLOBALS.PAS  The maximum length of an object ID name was increased to 31
UOUTPUT.PAS   characters + a terminating character.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ALL FILES     Epanet2w.exe was recompiled using Delphi 7.
================================================================================

-----------------------
Build 2.00.12 (2/25/08)
-----------------------

Computational Engine Changes (epanet2.dll and epanet2d.exe):
===============================================================================
CODE MODULES  CHANGES
===============================================================================
EPANET.C      Temporary files are now written to the users's current working
INPUT1.C      directory or to the designated Temporary Directory when running
VARS.H        the Windows GUI, thus avoiding file access problems for users
FUNCS.H       who do not have administrative privileges on their machine.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EPANET.C      The following tank parameters were made available for retrieval
TOOLKIT.H     using the Toolkit's ENgetnodevalue function: tank diameter,
EPANET2.H     minimum volume, index of the tank's volume curve, the initial,
              minimum, and maximum water levels, the fraction of a 2-compart-
              ment tank devoted to the mixing zone, and the tank's bulk
              reaction rate coefficient. These same parameters (with the
              exception of the volume curve) were made modifiable using the
              ENsetnodevalue function, as was the choice of mixing model.
              See the Toolkit Help file for details.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EPANET.C      A new Toolkit function, ENaddpattern, was added that allows
TOOLKIT.C     programmers to add a new time pattern to the network in any
EPANET2.H     custom code that they write.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HYDRAUL.C     A DAMPLIMIT parameter was added to control at what point during
INPUT1.C      the hydraulic solution iterations status checks on PRVs and PSVs
INPUT3.C      begin and subsequent flow changes are dampened.
REPORT.C
VARS.H
TEXT.H
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HYDRAUL.C     Demands for tanks (net inflows/outflows) were not always being
              set to zero when the tank was full or empty which was causing
              problems in the water quality routing solutions.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
QUALITY.C     The water quality functions for all of the tank mixing models
              were modified so as to produce more robust results for cases
              where there is a significant amount of volume exchange over a
              water quality time step.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EPANET.C      A problem with the system not recognizing that water quality
QUALITY.C     reactions could begin after some initial period of time when
VARS.H        the Toolkit was used to modify reaction rate coefficients was
              fixed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INPFILE.C     A problem with extraneous lines being written to the [REPORT]
              section of an EPANET input file created with the ENsaveinpfile
              function was fixed. Also the number of decimal places for some
	      items written to the saved file, such as nodal demands, was
	      increased.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TYPES.H       The code version was changed to 20012 and INT4 was explicitly
              defined as an "int" data type.
===============================================================================

User Interface Changes (epanet2w.exe)
===============================================================================
CODE MODULES  CHANGES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UIMPORT.PAS   The previously undocumented parameters CHECKFREQ and MAXCHECK
UINPUT.PAS    and the new parameter DAMPLIMIT were added to the list of
UGLOBALS.PAS  Hydraulic Options that can be edited within the Property Editor.
UEXPORT.PAS   See the Help file topic "Analysis Options - Hydraulics" for
CONSTS.TXT    the meaning of these parameters.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DCURVE.PAS    A bug in the Delphi charting package was worked around by
              requiring that curves edited in the Curve Editor dialog must have
	      at least 2 points to be displayed.
===============================================================================

User Interface Changes (epanet2w.exe)
===============================================================================
CODE MODULES  CHANGES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EPANET2.CHM   The original Help file EPANET2.HLP was converted to Microsoft's
              HTML format so that it works with the newer versions of Windows.
TUTORIAL.CHM  The same conversion was made to the original TUTORIAL.HLP file.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ALL FILES     Epanet2w.exe was recompiled using Delphi 10. This required minor
              changes to numerous files to make the old Delphi 7 code compatible
              with Delphi 10.

Re-Build 2.00.12.01 (10/1/18)
-----------------------------
User Interface Changes (epanet2w.exe)
===============================================================================
CODE MODULES  CHANGES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PROPEDIT.PAS  The Delphi 10 conversion introduced a bug that prevented a water
              quality source being added or edited correctly at a node. This
              has now been fixed.
